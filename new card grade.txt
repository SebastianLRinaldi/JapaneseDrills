grab sentence audio from anki and try and dictate the words and or 
another app where I try and guess verb tense from audio only

All note that reach the sateg of being a genrational card, then we suspend them
then we can grab them in out japanese drills of real word usage and such in chatgpt quizes instead

All card types should be 
Different cue - same output 
1) immedate regoniztion for the word being seen, doesnt feel like idk what this is
2) do we get the meaning of the word naturally either as a defintion/phrae/image or 
	some type of sounds that lets use know the deinftion
3) Can we type the reading from memory or some conjugation of the word
