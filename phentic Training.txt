Where do I embed the meaning so that the input can drive the meaning automaticaly

Reading
- based on the way the kanji is drawn is where I embed meaning
- I can see a  scene in the kanji or potently a scene of by looking at the lines in the kanji

Typing
- phonetic


Listening
- Encode the feeling:
- Focus not on the definition, but on the meaing you feel when hearing it.



for web we should do something like if we find a core list table to basicaly 
grab the table, show/hide columns 
print rows to a list only check boxed rows





input --> imbed somthing to make path to recall meaning easier


defintion --> reading --> meaning
- phentic memomentic that matches reading or creates some mental picture of reading and meaning

kanji vocab --> reading --> meaning
- What it looks like we can create a image or scene and attact meaning and or reading to kanji

reading (no text only audio) --> reading --> meaning


img defintion --> meaning --> reading
- already gives us mental img of thing so its eaier to recall
